# Improving Lab Services at MedLab Diagnostics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes patient and test data from MedLab Diagnostics, a biomedical lab in Kumasi, Ghana. The objective is to uncover patterns in test usage, patient retention, and service efficiency—and provide data-backed recommendations to improve operations and revenue.

## Data Structure
The dataset includes the following components:
- **Test Data**: Patient ID, test type, category, and visit time.
- **Performance Summary**: Aggregated KPIs including revenue, return rate, and test frequency.
- **Dashboard**: Visual summaries of trends in test demand, turnaround time, and patient flow.
- **Recommendations**: Business insights based on data analysis.

## Key Findings
- **Test Utilization**
  • Full Blood Count, Pregnancy Test, and Glucose are the most requested tests.
  • Tests like Cardiac Enzymes and Coagulation are underutilized.

- **Patient Retention**
  • 77.5% of patients are new; only 22.5% return.
  • Follow-up communication and loyalty programs are lacking.

- **Peak Hour Congestion**
  • Most visits occur during peak hours, causing longer wait times and slower test results.

- **Revenue by Test Category**
  • Biochemistry and Endocrinology generate the highest income.
  • Several test categories are low-performing despite potential value.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Structured patient records and test information for clarity.
- **KPI Tracking**: Created visual metrics such as total patients, average result time, and revenue by category.
- **Dashboard Design**: Built interactive visuals in Excel and Power BI to highlight trends.
- **Insight Development**: Converted raw numbers into business recommendations.

## Visualization & Insights
The project includes:
- A Power BI dashboard visualizing key performance metrics.
- Charts showing test demand, visit timing, and patient return rate.
- Clear comparisons of peak vs. off-peak service time.

## Conclusion
MedLab can boost its performance by:
- Promoting underused tests through bundles and campaigns.
- Improving patient retention with SMS reminders and loyalty rewards.
- Shifting demand to off-peak hours with scheduling tools and staff realignment.
- Using simple tracking software to monitor performance regularly.
